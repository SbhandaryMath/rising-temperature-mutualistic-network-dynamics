# mutualistic-dynamics-rising-temperature
Compilation of the above codes can be carried in any version of matlab compatible with any OS and require no additional dependencies.

Here the codes are presented for simulating the temperature dependent dynamics of the mutualistic networks and all related experiments. They are written for Matlab.
Other associated details related to the study and numerical simulations may be found in the methods section of the main draft and SI appendix.

The empirical interaction networks may be downloaded from Web of Life: Ecological Networks Database~``http://www.web-of-life.es/".
A sample real data is given in the folder "Data" and may be used for validation purpose.
