# mutualistic-dynamics-rising-temperature
Compilation of the above codes can be carried in any version of matlab compatible with any OS and require no additional dependencies.
The codes presented here are the minimal core for simulating the temperature dependent dynamics of the mutualistic networks. They are written for Matlab.
The empirical interaction networks may be downloaded from Web of Life: Ecological Networks Database~``http://www.web-of-life.es/".
A sample real data is given in the folder Data and may be used for validation purpose. The climate data may be downloaded from (https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6).
